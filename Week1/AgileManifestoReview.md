# Agile Manifesto Review
> Review of Agile manifesto and principles of Agile Manifest on pg 2 of "Agile Software Development -..."

### Potential limitations
- Limited support for distributed development
- Limited support for subcontracting
- Limited support for building reusable artifacts
- Limited support for development involving large teams

### Projects that benefit most from Agile
- Poorly defined requirements
- High level of complexity
- Risk of failure is high
- High development platform flexibility

# Scrum Basics from "Scrum is Simple!"
## Scrum Roles
- Product Owner:
    - Represents the voice of the customer
    - Writes the user stories
    - Prioritizes user stories in backlog
- Scrum Master:
    - Protects team from distractions
    - Leads process
- Team:
    - Self-organized and self-managing

## Scrum activities
- Daily scrum (Stand-up)
    - Starts on time at the same location and same time every day
    - Time-boxed at 15 or fewer minutes
    - Side conversations are not allowed
    - One team member talks at a time until all have spoken. All others listen
    - Problems are ID, but solutions are deferred to specific persons after the stand-up
    - Others are welcomed, but only the core roles are allowed to speak
- During the meeting, each team member responds to three questions:
    - What have you done since the last stand-up meeting?
    - What are you planning to do next?
    - What impediments do you have that prevent you from accomplishing your work?
    - Do you have any issues?

## Sprint Planning
During first half, the project owner what needs to be done for that sprint with a priority on backlog items which allows the team a better understanding when estimating work load. <br />
During the second half of Sprint Planning, the team does the following:
- Calc "velocity" of how much they think they can complete with a high probability
- Select backlog items from the product backlog based on their vel.
- Define acceptance criteria that will become systems tests
- Determine how it will build the selected items by decomposing each selected backlog item into tasks
- Coordinates with the PO on sprint goals and helps define "Done"
- Decides the location and time for the daily stand-ups

## Sprint Retrospective
Purpose:
- Build team's commitment and transfer knowledge learned to the next sprint and to other teams.
- Time-boxed meeting conducted by members of the team at the conclusion of every sprint to accomplish the following:
    - Discuss what was successful about the sprint or release
    - Determine was could or must be improved before proceeding
    - Learn from exp and plan for the future
    - ID successes and improvements for future projs
    - Discover, share, and pass along the learning exp
    - Make changes for the next sprint
- A retrospective is not a:
    - Session to ID mistakes and place personal blame
    - Place for personal attacks
    - Meeting to resolve issues
    - Planning meeting
<br /><br /><br />

# Updated Scrum Values (2020)
Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage
### Product owner must articulate the product goal:
- Future state of the product
- Long term objective for the Scrum team
### Scrum master is accountable for Scrum team's effectiveness
- Future state of the product
- Long term objective for the Scrum team
### Scrum events
- The Sprint is the container for all events:
    - Opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts
- Sprint planning addresses three topics:
    - Why is this Sprint valuable?
        - Need to articulate Sprint Goal
    - What can be done this Sprint?
    - How will the chosen work be done?
        - Need to decompose work.
- Sprint Review involves inspecting the outcome of the Sprint
- Sprint Retrospective looks to increase quality and effectiveness
### Increments
- Increments are concrete stepping stones toward the product goal
    - Multiple increments may be created within a Sprint.
    - Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
    - Must meet Definition of Done to be released
<br /><br /><br />
------------------------------------------------------------------

## Daily Stand-Up Meetings
- There are clear Scrum guidelines how 15-minute meeting should be held
    - Lots of variation
- 3 standard questions:
    - What did I do yesterday?
    - What will I do today?
    - Do I see any impediments?
- Paper researched and tracked meetings in four companies
## Main criticism is that most daily Stand-ups is used for reporting.
## Recommendations from the paper:
### Stop asking, "What did you do yesterday?"
- Reduce the time spent on status reporting and self-justification
- focus on future work, particularly dependencies and obstacles
- Spend time discussing and solving problems as well as making quick decisions
### Optimize the communication pattern
- Share the leadership to increase joint responsibility, such as by rotating the facilitator role.
- Team members should communicate with each other and not report to the facilitator.
### Find the least disruptive time
- Right before lunch is usually good
### Find the frequency that offers the most value
- In a team that communicates well, stop meeting daily if three or four times a week is sufficient.
- In a large team, some members do not need to meet as frequently as others, depending on the interdependencies among tasks and members.

# Why is Sprint Zero a Critical Activity
In Scrum, project prep activities are known as sprint zero. <br />
- Key activities
    - Define roles
    - List of prioritized features along with estimates
    - Release plan
        - Assigns features/stories to a sprint
