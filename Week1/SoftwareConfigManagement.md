# Software Configuration Management (SCM)
Dates back to late 1940's (missile program) <br />
What is SCM?
- ID the configuration of the sw at given points in time
- systematically controlling changes to the config
- maintaining the integrity and traceability of the config throughout the sw lifecycle.

### Objectives and benefits of SCM
- Increased product quality
- Reduced life cycle costs
- Increase man. visibility
- Improved communication
- Increased productivity
- Reproducibility and reuse

### CM Process
CM is structured into four integrated processes:
- Configuration Identification
- Configuration Control
- Configuration Status Accounting
- Configuration Audits

## Configuration Identification
> A config item (CI) is an aggregation of items (HW, SW, docs, and/or data), or any of its discrete portions, that satisfies and end use function, or set of functions

> Configuration Identification involves selecting the CIs for a system and recording their functional and physical characteristics in technical documentation.

## Config control
> Consists of the systematic proposal, justification, evaluation, coordination, approval, or disapproval of proposed changes, and the imp of approved changes in the config of a config item.

> Establishment of repositories:
>- safeguarding and retrieval of work products
>- disaster recovery

### Change Control Board
The Config control Board shall be formed for the evaluation and approval or disapproval of proposed changes prior to implementation and/or submittal to the customer.

## Configuration Status Accounting
Config Status Accounting consists of recording and reporting of information needed to manage a configuration effectively.
- Use tools!

This information includes:
- A listing of the approved configuration identification
- The status of proposed changes to the configuration
- The implementation status of approved changes

## Configuration Audit
Configuration Auditing consists of independent examinations of work products and activities to assess compliance with designated criteria <br />
Tech reviews and audits are conducted to help ensure a controlled evolution of the product from its conceptual to production phase

# SW configuration management can be code, work products, testing, etc...
