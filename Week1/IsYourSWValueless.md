# Is your Software Valueless Lecture Notes
> This is a paper about cultural and societal values in relation to the software we make.
### SW development ignores human values
- Tradition
- Benevolence
- Conformity
- Power
- Security

### Prioritize product backlog based on customer value:
- Possible include human value
- Consider values guardian to assist with identifying value stories.
### Participatory design methods help with values

Big question of paper is, "How would we do this"

## My thoughts...

If being hired to create a product for a customer, why would I insert my priorities into a product they need? If I don't agree with the values of the company requesting the software or if I don't agree with the outcome of what a piece of software will produce, I will choose not to participate in making that software.
