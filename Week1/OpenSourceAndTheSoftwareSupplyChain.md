# Software "Supply Chain"
Enterprise apps typically include 75-80% open source components <br />
- Products built of hundreds of components
- These components in turn built from others
    - Transitive dependencies
- Each component hs its own lifecycle, bug fixes, feature enhancements, and risks.
    - Security / intellectual property

# Component Life Cycle Management (CLM)
## Organizations should develop CLM:
Step 1: Gather info about current component usage <br />
Step 2: Understand vulnerabilities in application.<br />
    - Examine components for vulnerabilities<br />
Step 3: Control<br />
    - Review bulleted list on pg 3 of paper <br />
Step 4: Monitor updates<br />
    - Review Figure 4 (pg. 3)<br />
